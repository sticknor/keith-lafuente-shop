# Edit Shop

The shop pulls products, product images, prices, inventory etc. from a Shopify store. 

Menu Options: <br>
Shops on this site are organized by the Shopify product `type`. Set that field in Shopify on the products, and the menu will be auto-generated. 

Shop Item Order: <br>
The shop order is now set to newest products first. 
It accounts for when the product was `created`, not `edited`.


# Edit Design

There is a lot to customize! Use the Airtable to edit backgrounds, colors, icons, and text content. 
With all of the airtable edits, it will take about 10 seconds to update on the site.
Go back to the site and refresh!

Updating colors: <br>
Use a valid hexadecimal format eg `#ffffff`.

Updating FAQ: <br>
Add questions and answers as a new row in the FAQ tab

Updating About Text, Email, Instagram: <br>
See the About tab

Updating Favicon: <br>
See the About tab <br>
The favicon is the icon that appears in the browser tab
For ease of customization, I set it up to use emojis.
You can find new emojis to copy/paste here: https://emojipedia.org/
